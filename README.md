My partners in today's Lab were Hydeia Blakey and Josue Ramirez-Romero

1. SwitchSattement Exercise:
- Write out a Switch Statement for the pseudo code below

- Assume star wars is your favorite movie.

- If favoriteMovie is "jaws"

- Assign moviePhrase the value "You're gonna need a bigger boat."

- Else if favoriteMovie is "the shining"

- Assign moviePhrase the value "All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy."

- Else if favoriteMovie is "star wars"

- Assign moviePhrase the value "Do. Or do not. There is no try."

- Else if favoriteMovie is "forrest gump"

- Assign moviePhrase the value "Life was like a box of chocolates."

- Else if favoriteMovie is "back to the future"

-  Assign moviePhrase the value "Where we're going, we don't need roads."

-  Else
-  Assign moviePhrase the value "Great movie choice!"


2. Fizzbuzz Exercise:
- If x is evenly divisible by both 3 and 5 (for example 0 or 15), set result to “fizzbuzz”.

- Otherwise if x is evenly divisible by 3 (for example, 3, 6, or 9), set result to “fizz”.

- Otherwise if x is evenly divisible by 5(for example, 10 or 15), set result to “buzz”.

- If x is not evenly divisible by either 3 or 5 (for example 8), set result to x.

- To test your code, set a value for x, and console.log it. Try different values. 

Part 2
Taking what we learned from the conditionals practice with fizzbuzz, We are going to Loop through every number from 1 to max, applying those same exact rules to each number and, before ending the loop, printing out result to the console via console.log(result). A For Loop would work.
